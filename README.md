# hello-world
Hello GitHub,

I've been persuing the OSSU CS learning track
https://github.com/ossu/computer-science

I have completed Python for Everybody 
https://www.edx.org/course/programming-for-everybody-getting-started-with-pyt

and Python data Structures on edx.org
https://www.edx.org/course/python-data-structures

I am currently half way through MITx 6.00.1x
Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python
https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-7

These courses have been very challenging and I have thouroughly enjoyed them.
At the same time I have been learning more about Linux and have started to 
learn Vim. 

I also work full time in non CS related employment.
My goal is to start a career in CS.
